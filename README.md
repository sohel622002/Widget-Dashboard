Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

    Start by cloning the repository to your local machine
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sohel622002/Widget-Dashboard.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
    ```base
    cd Widget-Dashboard
    ```

3. Install Dependencies:

    npm install
    ```

## Running the App

1. Start the Development Server:

    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:
    ```base
    npm run dev
    ```
2. Open in Browser:

    After the development server starts, you can view your application by opening your browser and navigating to:
